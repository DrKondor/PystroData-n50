PystroData-n50
==============

Configure speedpad n50 &amp; Pystromo to work w/Linux creative apps. Inkscape and Krita, particularly. There are lots of configs out there for the n52, but the n50 is not as easily supported. One thing the n50 has is a throttle in place of a continuous scroll wheel. I have been unable to get the throttle to work, which is a huge drag. I'd like to set it to zoom in and out.
